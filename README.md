# TechDegree7


 The Project 
 
 The goal for this project was to create a static or interactive Dashboard from a mock-up. We had to display a responsive chart element which dymanically shows different data. As well as save users settings in local storage. 
 
The Process 

1. Treehouse gave an example for the first chart, and to get an "Exceeds" score we had to dynamically instantiate each graph object based on the button that was clicked (eg. "Daily", "Weekly"). Which was actualy simpler than I thought and after some reading I found the charts were created through instantiating a new chart object.

2. The autocomplete list was mutated from W3 and made the variables match and fixed the styling to match the rest of the page. It did not have proper keyboard navigation potentially causing problems for accessiblity and some of the code was deprecated and had to be updated.
<example>
3. I found the most challenging was using local storage to save the setting for timzone and the checkbox values.I had the concepts correct but took a couple tries to get the proper syntax in place.
<example>
4. SVG images were used for icons and links and this project had us use them both inline and as an image.

Summary 
 
The seventh Tech Degree was a challenging project. Treehouse often provides some basic html and css to get started on the later projects but this one was from scratch with a mock-up as well as being the biggest project in the Trrehouse curriculum to-date and included our first introduction to SVG images. Grid was used for responsive layout.
