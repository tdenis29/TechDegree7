# TechDegree7
 
The seventh Tech Degree was a challenging project. Treehouse often provides some basic html and css to get started on the later projects but this one was from scratch with a mock-up. Learning from previous challenges, I was wary that Treehouse would introduce concepts that they hadn't covered yet. Sure enough they did. I learned alot in this project:

1. They showed us how to instantiate the first graph in the portfolio files, and to get an "Exceeds" score we had to dynamically instantiate each graph object based on the button that was clicked (eg. "Daily", "Weekly"). Which was actualy simpler than I thought and I totally lucked out reading the charts.js docs and googling new Object from the class and using and if else statement. 

2. The autocomplete list was easy enough to implement but I really just mutated the one from W3 tutorials and made the variables match and fixed the styling to match the rest of the page. It did not have proper keyboard navigation potentially causing problems for accessiblity and much of the code was deprecated and had to be updated.

3. I found the most challenging was using local storage to save the setting for timzone and the checkbox values.I had the concepts correct but took a couple tries to get the value to be saved to local storage on re-load.

4. Don't forget the veiwport meta tag.
